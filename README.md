## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install server dependencies
cd server && npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd client && npm install
```

### Run Locally

Start both the server and client in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Start the backend (runs on port 8080)
cd server && node server.js

# Terminal 2 — Start the frontend (runs on port 3000)
cd client && npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. The client makes API calls to `http://localhost:8080` by default (configured in `client/src/config.json`).
